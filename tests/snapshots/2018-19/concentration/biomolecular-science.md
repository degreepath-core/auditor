> This is the set of requirements for the 2018-19 Bachelor of Arts “Biomolecular
> Science” concentration from St. Olaf College.

# Biomolecular Science
For this concentration, you must complete “Core”, “Experiential Learning”, and “Electives”.

## Core
For this requirement, you must do all of the following:

- take BIO 150
- do one of the following:
  
  - take CHEM 125, CHEM 126, and BIO 227
  - take all of the following courses:
    
    - CHEM 121
    - CHEM 123
    - CHEM 126
    - BIO 227

- take both CHEM 247 and CHEM 253
- take both CHEM 248 and CHEM 254
- take both CHEM 379 and CHEM 373


## Experiential Learning
> Note: Participation in an experimentally based research experience or
> employment that takes biomolecular sciences beyond the traditional classroom
> is required of each concentrator. This can occur either on- or off-campus.
> This activity must be pre-approved by the Biomolecular Science Committee and
> be supported after the fact by a letter from a supervisor.
